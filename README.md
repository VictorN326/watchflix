# Watchflix is like a netflix clone/imdb clone but instead of actually watching movies, we can see reviews and cast of the people in movies and shows.
It uses Alan voice ai to help give information about the website and change some things for you on the site!
The app is functional but to make 100% use such as using the favorite and watchlist feature, a created account is needed. You can do this by going into login
into themoviedb.org and create an account with them, sign in and go back to the site or refresh. If you don't want to make an account and just see for yourself
Here is an image that shows when you favorite and watchlist a movie. It stores into your account and the button animations changes!

Try some commands  like:
'What does this app do?', 'What is this app about?', ' Change the mode to dark', 'change the mode to light', 'Search for (NAME_OF_YOUR_MOVIE)', 
'Give me something funny', "Log me in", "Log me out".
I will be adding more features to the site and fixing bugs if any of them are presented or do come up!
